# sql-challenge
This challenge is part of the edX Boot Camps LLC. There is a fictional company with CSV file data sets. The task was to reserch the people employed during the 1980s and 1990s. First I viewed the CSVs and designed an Entity Relationship Diagram using QuickDBD. Then I created tables using postgreSQL and uploaded the CSV files. All of this information is held in the tables.sql file. Then I ran queries to analyze the data and saved these in a queries.sql file. 

I utilized Chatgpt, AskBCS Learning Assistants as well as my tutor for this assignment.
